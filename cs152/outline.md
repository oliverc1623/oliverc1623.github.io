# CS152 Project Outline

## Name: 

Crossing the Reality Gap

## Group Members:

- Oliver Chang

## Outline: 

Neural networks are becoming an increasingly useful tool in autonomous navigation, but it is expensive so we turn to simulations. 

Over the summer, the ARCS lab surveyed multiple CNN architectures in the Raycasting simulation. Next, we seek to implement a more robust model in an Unreal simulation. 

The Raycasting simulation is computationally cheap to run, but sacrifices high definition detail. Hence, we will continue the same data collection methods in Raycasting, but apply them to Unreal. 

Given weâ€™ll be working with two environments, it is imperative that we synchronize our data collection methods, CNN implementation, and data analysis. 

Ideally, a model trained in the unreal engine should be able to traverse the Raycasting simulation and real-life autonomously. 

## Ethics: 

Since we are working with autonomous robots, we seek to create a product that will never inflict harm on other humans. More specifically, this technology should not be used as weapons of war in destructive ways.
